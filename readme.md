Challenges for <a href="https://github.com/sf-wdi-24/modules/tree/master/week-11-front-end-frameworks-and-mobile/day-01/module-01" target="">Angular Auth</a> lesson.

**Objective:** Implement Angular authentication with Satellizer. Your goal is to have working sign up and log in functionality.

**You should be pair programming the entire time you work on these challenges. That means you're using ONE computer at a time, and ONLY the "driver" is allowed to type (you'll switch roles throughout the lab).**

## Setup

1. Whoever is going to be the "driver" first should fork this repo, and clone it into their `develop` folder on their local machine. The "navigator" must close their computer.

2. Once you're in your app directory, run `npm install` to install the required `node_modules`.

3. In one Terminal window, run `mongod`, and in another, run `nodemon`.

4. Navigate to `localhost:3000` in the browser. You should see an empty page and an angry red error message in the Chrome console.

5. **BEFORE WRITING ANY CODE**, open up `models/user.js`, `resources/auth.js`, and `server.js`. The driver should go through these files in order and explain what you think each code block and/or function does.

6. Now it's the navigator's turn to explain code! Open up `index.hbs` and `app.js`, and go through the same exercise.
